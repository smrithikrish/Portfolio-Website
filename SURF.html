        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p> Over this summer, I worked in the Infant Language Learning Lab (ILLL) on a study using functional Near-Infrared Spectroscopy (fNIRS) to explore learning in comprehension with brain connectivity in children. The project investigates how their brains respond to different forms of media and whether patterns of activation suggest emerging functional connectivity relevant to later cognitive control.</p>

<p>Using fNIRS, we recorded both blood flow and oxygen levels in prefrontal and temporal brain regions while children listened to a video story, interactively read a story with a researcher, or watched an episode of Bluey. I was involved in preparing and running pilot testing sessions, including cap setup, signal quality checking, and ensuring data reliability across sessions in addition to engaging wih the children. </p>

<p>A major focus of my work was in the preprocessing and exploratory analysis of fNIRS data. I performed signal cleaning and PCA (Principal Component Analysis) to reduce dimensionality and identify dominant patterns in channel activity. Our PCA findings revealed that PC1 loadings were symmetrically distributed across the left and right hemispheres**, suggesting bilateral engagement, while PC2 was driven by more right-lateralized channels. These patterns may reflect early functional specialization and could potentially relate to connectivity profiles linked to executive attention.</p>

<p>We are currently using these PCA results to guide future connectivity analyses and to refine our hypotheses about regional interactions during early language and cognitive development. This summer laid the groundwork for full-scale data collection and analysis planned for the academic year.</p>

        <h2>Reflection</h2>
        <p>The SURF program at CMU also included instructional programming and the opportunity to participate in a 3MRT event, where I condensed my summer work into 1 slide that be convered in 3 minutes. I met very talented and knowledgable researchers as we were taught by panelists on how to effectively give such a presentation, and I gained the ability to share my knowledge in a way that anyone can understand. These are important skills I will use in my career and education moving foward, and I am grateful for the opportunity to learn this summer!</p>
